        <para>
        	Gallery of images, which was my second task consisted in the fact that I'm using the jQuery loaded from the directory gallery on the server all files with the extension .png, .jpg, .gif, etc. Then I've shifted these files between several div's in an endless loop, and thus created the impression of animation an automatically played gallery.

        <title>Conclusion</title>
        <para>
        	The project was developed according to the requirements entered by the client within the required deadline.
