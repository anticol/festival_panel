It had to include multiple
            features such as displaying the current program from XML data, fetching images from Instagram with a
            specified hashtag, fully operational administration interface and so on.
        </p><p>My role in the team was to develop front-end of the web application that is split into cycling scenes
            where each scene shows a different content. I designed program scene dynamically updating its content
            according to XML file retrieved from the server. This included parsing and visualizing XML data in form of
            auto generated HTML document. For this purpouse I used JavaScript programming language.
        </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="idm45603217366576"/>Solution</h2></div></div></div><p>JavaScript is a client-side scripting language running in every modern web browser. It implements a
            Document Object Model (DOM) which is a basic interface to process and access the tree representation of XML
            data. HTML DOM allows to dynamically generate HTML and CSS code from JavaScript and contains the browser
            environment. JavaScript also includes an Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX) which supports asynchronous
            communication with webservers using HTTP protocol. Using AJAX it is possible to send HTTP requests and
            receive responses. In JavaScript, AJAX is implemented by XMLHttpRequest object that can fetch XML data
            without refreshing a web browser. Combining HTML DOM and AJAX it is easy to create and update content of a
            HTML page.
        </p><p>Action flow of the program scene was to fetch XML file with infomation about all events at Animefest.
            After the server's response I parse the XML document and spilt events into two groups by time. The scene
            always displays which events are currently held in main halls and also events in other minor halls if there
            are any. For each hall I displayed its name, the current running event and the next event with its title and
            time. Every half an hour I reshfreshed the scene with data from XML document. If a refresh button on admin
            page is clicked, the flow is started all over again.
        </p><p>I cooperated with my teammates on a design of the scene and a handling admin refresh events. Beside the
            programming we collaborated on writing GitLab wiki pages and presentation slides.

            be a part of team and participate on develpment of a useful product for Animefest guests which helped to
            easily orientate in a festival's program. I consider it as a great opportunity to improve my skills as a
            front-end web developer.
